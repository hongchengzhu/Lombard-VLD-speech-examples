# Speech examples of DB-MMLC

## Notes
This page provides several groups of speech samples from our self-made DB-MMLC (Multi-factor Mandarin Lombard corpus) so that reviewers can more directly and intuitively feel the acoustic differences of live speakers caused by the Lombard effect.

## Congratulations
Our paper titled "Lombard-VLD: Voice Liveness Detection Based on Human Auditory Feedback" has been accepted by IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy (S&P) 2025!
